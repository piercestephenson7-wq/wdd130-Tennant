        <p id="p1">Mythological stories have been told throughout human history </p>
        <p id="p2">From well known stories like Ragnarok, a fierce battle where gods fight for the fate of the world, to lesser known stories like The story of Kitsune and the Moon, a story where a fox spirit steals moonlight from the heavens </p>
        <p id="p3">Each tale reflects the culture of those that make them, showing their values, fears, and goals all told through messages and themes of these stories </p>
        <p id="p4">Myths  have commonly been used to explain natural desasters and events like earth quakes and volcanoes, preserve cultral heritage, and provide comfert during difficult trials </p>
        <p id="p5">By exploring these stories we can come to a better understanding of other cultures and what it means to be human</p>
